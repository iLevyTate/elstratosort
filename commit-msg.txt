feat(organization): wire learning feedback into app workflow

- Record feedback on manual file moves into smart folders
- Record implicit feedback when SmartFolderWatcher analyzes files in smart folders
- Register and configure LearningFeedbackService in DI
- Add optional startup scan to learn from existing analyzed files

This connects implicit organization signals to the suggestion engine without
blocking core file operations.
