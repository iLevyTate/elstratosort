# Critical Runtime Error Fix: Null Reference in TooltipManager

## Issue Summary

**Error:** `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'get')` **Location:**
`dist/renderer.js` (lines 52051, 52070 in bundled code) **Component:** `TooltipManager.jsx`
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Blocking user interaction with the application

## Root Cause Analysis

The error was caused by a race condition in the `TooltipManager` component where:

1. **WeakMap Nullification During Cleanup**: The component's cleanup function was setting
   `titleCacheRef.current` to `null` (line 191 in original code)

2. **Event Handlers Still Active**: JavaScript event handlers could still fire after the cleanup
   process started but before the component was fully unmounted

3. **Unchecked Access**: The code was calling `.get()` and `.set()` methods on the WeakMap without
   checking if it was null first

### Specific Problem Areas

1. **Line 63** (original): Direct call to `titleCacheRef.current.get(target)` without null check
2. **Line 85** (original): Direct call to `titleCacheRef.current.get(target)` without null check
3. **Cleanup sequence**: Refs were being nullified while event listeners were still active

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Defensive Null Checks

Modified all WeakMap access points to check for null before calling methods:

```javascript
// Before (line 63)
if (!titleCacheRef.current.get(target)) {

// After
if (titleCacheRef.current && !titleCacheRef.current.get(target)) {
```

### 2. Improved Event Handler Safety

Added ref validation at the beginning of all event handlers:

```javascript
const delegatedMouseOver = (e) => {
  // Check if refs are still valid before processing events
  if (!tooltipRef.current || !titleCacheRef.current) return;
  // ... rest of handler
};
```

### 3. Optimized Cleanup Sequence

Reorganized the cleanup function to prevent race conditions:

```javascript
return () => {
  // 1. Remove event listeners first (prevents new events)
  document.removeEventListener('mouseover', delegatedMouseOver, true);
  // ... other listeners

  // 2. Cancel pending animations
  cancelAnimationFrame(rafRef.current);

  // 3. Hide tooltip if showing (uses refs while still valid)
  if (currentTargetRef.current && titleCacheRef.current) {
    hideTooltip(currentTargetRef.current);
  }

  // 4. Clear refs in correct order
  currentTargetRef.current = null;

  // 5. Remove DOM elements
  if (tooltipRef.current && tooltipRef.current.parentNode) {
    tooltipRef.current.parentNode.removeChild(tooltipRef.current);
  }

  // 6. Clear remaining refs last
  tooltipRef.current = null;
  arrowRef.current = null;
  titleCacheRef.current = null;
};
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/renderer/components/TooltipManager.jsx`**
   - Added null checks before all Map/WeakMap operations
   - Added ref validation in all event handlers
   - Reorganized cleanup sequence to prevent race conditions
   - Improved error resilience throughout the component

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Rapid Navigation**: Test switching between different phases quickly
2. **Tooltip Interaction**: Hover over elements with tooltips during navigation
3. **Component Unmounting**: Test scenarios where components unmount while tooltips are active
4. **Browser Tab Switching**: Test visibility change events (minimize/restore window)
5. **Memory Leaks**: Monitor for any memory leaks from event listeners

## Prevention Measures

### Best Practices Applied

1. **Always Check Refs Before Use**: Any ref that can be nullified should be checked
2. **Remove Event Listeners First**: In cleanup, always remove listeners before nullifying refs
3. **Defensive Programming**: Assume refs can be null at any point during cleanup
4. **Proper Cleanup Order**: Follow the sequence: listeners → animations → DOM → refs

### Code Review Checklist

- [ ] All `.current` accesses on refs are null-checked
- [ ] Event handlers validate refs before processing
- [ ] Cleanup functions follow proper sequencing
- [ ] No async operations access refs without validation
- [ ] WeakMap/Map operations are wrapped in null checks

## Impact Assessment

### Fixed Issues

- Eliminated `Cannot read properties of null` errors
- Prevented application crashes during navigation
- Improved component unmount safety
- Enhanced overall application stability

### Performance Impact

- Minimal: Added null checks have negligible performance cost
- Improved: Prevents error propagation and console spam
- Better user experience with stable tooltips

## Verification Steps

1. Build the application: `npm run build` ✅
2. Run the application and navigate between phases
3. Interact with tooltips during navigation
4. Monitor console for any remaining errors
5. Run test suite: `npm test test/TooltipManager.test.js`

## Long-term Recommendations

1. **Add ESLint Rule**: Configure ESLint to warn about unchecked ref access
2. **Unit Tests**: Maintain test coverage for cleanup scenarios
3. **Component Lifecycle Documentation**: Document proper cleanup patterns
4. **Code Review Focus**: Pay special attention to ref usage in reviews

## Conclusion

The fix successfully addresses the root cause of the null reference error by:

- Adding comprehensive null checks throughout the component
- Implementing proper cleanup sequencing
- Ensuring all event handlers validate refs before use
- Following defensive programming principles

The application should now be stable and free from the critical runtime error that was blocking user
interaction.
