## Implementation Order

1. **Critical Path** (Do First):
   - DownloadWatcher integration
   - Basic error handling
   - Settings UI for thresholds

2. **User Experience** (Do Second):
   - Visual feedback improvements
   - Performance optimization
   - Basic testing

3. **Polish** (Do Last):
   - Documentation
   - Migration tools
   - Advanced features

## Code Locations

### Files to Modify

```
src/main/services/DownloadWatcher.js       # Use AutoOrganizeService
src/main/simple-main.js                    # Pass service to watcher
src/renderer/components/settings/          # Add threshold controls
  AutoOrganizeSection.jsx
```

### Files to Create

```
test/organization-suggestion.test.js       # Service tests
test/auto-organize.test.js                 # Auto-organize tests
docs/SUGGESTION_USER_GUIDE.md              # User documentation
scripts/migrate-organization.js            # Migration script
```

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Downloads auto-organize with >80% accuracy
- [ ] Settings allow full threshold customization
- [ ] Errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Tests provide >80% coverage
- [ ] Performance: <100ms per suggestion
- [ ] User satisfaction: Reduced manual organization by 70%

## Notes

The core system is complete and functional. The remaining work is primarily:

1. **Integration** - Connecting existing services with new ones
2. **Polish** - UI feedback and error handling
3. **Testing** - Ensuring reliability
4. **Documentation** - Helping users understand the system
