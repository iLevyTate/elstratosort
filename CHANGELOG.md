## [Unreleased]

## Release Checklist

See [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md) for versioning, runtime staging, checksums, and release
notes.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-01-29

### Improved

- **UI Consistency**: Standardized typography, spacing tokens, and button styles across renderer
  views.
- **Search & Graph UX**: Aligned metadata labels, banners, and empty states to shared Text/Heading
  components.

### Fixed

- **Organize UI**: Restored missing Button import in ReadyFileItem to prevent runtime crashes.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-01-27

### Added

- **Settings Backup & Restore**: Added backup service with import/export and restore UI.
- **User Data Migration**: Recover legacy settings/history/undo state before service startup.
- **Embedding Summaries**: Centralized embedding summary builder for richer semantic matching.

### Improved

- **Search & Chat**: Tuned hybrid retrieval, memory handling, and fallback responses.
- **Smart Folder Watcher**: Enhanced embedding metadata for better folder suggestions.
- **IPC & Validation**: Expanded schemas and hardened settings import validation.

### Fixed

- **Auto-Updater**: Listener cleanup and download progress reporting.
- **Settings Recovery**: Safer corruption recovery and backup integrity checks.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added

- **UNC Path Support**: Enhanced support for network paths (UNC) in setup, analysis, and watchers.
- **Demo Mode**: Implemented demo mode with path redaction and UI updates.
- **Organization Workflow**: Revamped organization workflow UI.
- **Discovery Phase**: Enhanced discovery phase UI and performance.

### Improved

- **Modernized UI**: Major updates to core UI components, styling, application shell, and global
  components.
- **Settings**: Modernized settings and dependency panels.
- **Analysis**: Improved folder scanning and network path resilience.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-23

### Added

- **Smart Folder Watcher**: Automatically analyzes new and modified files in configured smart
  folders (F-1)
- **Undo History Navigation**: Jump to specific points in undo history (L-2)
- **Retry Mechanism**: "Retry Failed Files" button in Discover phase (M-3)
- **Conflict Detection**: Warning banner when multiple files target the same destination path (M-4)
- **AI Description Generation**: "Generate with AI" button for smart folders (C-1)
- **Enhanced Graph Visualization**:
  - **Color-Coded Nodes**: Files in the Knowledge Graph are now color-coded by category
    (Blue=Documents, Purple=Images, etc.) for instant visual recognition.
  - **"Relationship Analysis" Tooltips**: Hovering over connection lines now explains _why_ files
    are connected (e.g., "Both Images", "Same Subject", "Shared Tags").
  - **Improved Layout**: Switched to `BRANDES_KOEPF` algorithm for straighter, more organized graph
    structures with better handling of outliers.
  - **Robust Data Handling**: Graph nodes now robustly display metadata even if underlying search
    results are nested or incomplete.
- **UI Spacing Improvements**:
  - Implemented `spacious` (32px) layout density in Setup Phase for a cleaner, less cluttered look.
  - Standardized grid gaps and padding across main views.
- Comprehensive test coverage for IPC handlers (settings.js, suggestions.js)
- SECURITY.md with vulnerability disclosure policy
- This CHANGELOG.md file
- E2E tests for semantic search functionality
- E2E tests for smart folder creation and verification
- DevTools auto-open in separate window during development (`npm run dev`)
- Error boundary around AnalysisResultsList to prevent crashes from malformed file data
- `getErrorMessage()` utility for consistent error extraction
- Centralized UI timeout constants (WIDGET_AUTO_SHOW, EMBEDDING_CHECK, STUCK_ANALYSIS_CHECK)

### Fixed

- **Critical**: Smart Folder Watcher race condition where watcher was null during IPC registration
  (NEW-1)
- **Critical**: DownloadWatcher starting before services initialized (C-2)
- **High**: Confidence slider resetting to 75% due to state race conditions (NEW-5/12)
- **High**: Undo/Redo UI not updating despite filesystem changes (H-3)
- **High**: Smart folder path loading race condition showing "Documents" string (H-1)
- **Medium**: Embeddings showing "0" count due to missing auto-refresh (NEW-2/9)
- **Medium**: "File in use" errors during auto-organize (NEW-4)
- **Medium**: Settings debounce flushing on close (H-2)
- **Medium**: Modal backdrop blur/z-index conflicts (F-3, M-1)
- **Medium**: Image files missing keywords in analysis history (NEW-10)
- **Medium**: Watcher reporting high confidence for unrelated files (NEW-11)
- **Critical**: LLM cache contamination causing wrong filename suggestions across file types
  - Added type discriminators (`type: 'document'` / `type: 'image'`) to cache keys
  - Added filename and content length to cache keys for uniqueness
  - Enhanced cache hit logging for debugging
- **Critical**: Stale closure in bulk category change causing wrong files to be updated
  - Used refs to always get latest values at debounce execution time
- **Critical**: Race condition in undo/redo system allowing concurrent action execution
  - Added mutex lock to prevent overlapping operations
  - Exposed `isExecuting` state for UI feedback
- **Critical**: UI Persistence issue where KnowledgeOS would reopen with only the file search
  visible
  - Switched `WIDGET_AUTO_SHOWN_KEY` and `MODAL_OPEN_STATE` to `localStorage` for robust state
    persistence across restarts.
- **Build System**: Fixed stale cache issues in development causing "Cannot find module" errors by
  adding a pre-build `clean` step.
- Toast timer reset when parent component re-renders with new callback reference
  - Used ref for onClose callback to maintain timer stability
- ResizeObserver not attaching when container ref is null on first render
  - Switched to callback ref pattern for proper observation
- localStorage access crashes in private browsing mode
  - Wrapped all localStorage operations in try-catch
- Infinite loop potential in persistence middleware
  - Added re-entry guard to prevent recursive saves
- UndoStack listener cleanup on component remount
  - Added mounted state tracking to prevent setState on unmounted components
- Error handling in FloatingSearchContext useEffect
- ProcessingStateService timestamp updates on save
- ESLint warnings in test files
- Navigation selector in E2E tests to target phase navigation buttons specifically
- Unused `useCallback` import in SearchAutocomplete.jsx

### Improved

- **UI**: Replaced emojis with professional Lucide icons (UI-2)
